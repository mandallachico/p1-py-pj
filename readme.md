<h2>Session 1</h2>

<h3>Episode 1 - First contact: Isn't a snake's name?</h3>

<b>What I did:</b>
<p>I did try make a different "Hello, Word!" with I had (some funny comments and a lot "ifs" for them &#128513). Some sequences tests, a litle data base with pandas library. 
  Last but not least, I made a simple calculator of body mass index.</p>
  
<b>What I did learn:</b> 
<p>At the start, I believe the initial code's complexity depends on the creativity and time of the person. I have learned that just because the start is simple, it doesn't 
  mean it can't be cool.&#128556</p>
